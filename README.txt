This is my attempt to complete course cs61a taught at Berkeley during spring 2011.
The course is based on fantastic "Structure and interpretation of computer programs".
Instructor is Brian Harvey and he's extremely good at this.
The lovely thing is that Berkeley got online everything you need to take this course remotely. Thank you.

EDIT: Some lectures from spring 2011 are missing (15, 27, 28, and 29), for thoses i'm taking lectures from fall 2010
